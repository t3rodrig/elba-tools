This directory contains scripts that can be used to post-process LAMMPS 
output files (to extract properties of interest, convert formats, etc.). 
See guidelines at the top of each script for usage information.

Most of the tools as quite general, so they can be used on data 
not necessarily generated with LAMMPS (though adjustments may be needed).
