# Script: calcNeighFrac.py
# Author: Mario Orsi (orsimario at gmail.com)
# Purpose: Reads a LAMMPS ".trj" trajectory (dump) file and, for a
#          user-defined type "i", calculates the fraction of nearest
#          neighbors of the same type "i" in the xy-plane
# Notes: - this script works for lipid bilayers arranged parallel to
#          the xy-plane, and it might need modifications to handle
#          different systems
#        - all and only the nearest 4 neighbors are considered (but
#          it should be easy to modify/generalize the script)
# Syntax: calcNeighFrac.py trjFile type typeNeigh
# Examples: - calcNeighFrac.py dump1000.trj 2 4
#           - calcNeighFrac.py dump89.trj   2 2
