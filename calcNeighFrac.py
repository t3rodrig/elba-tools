# Script: calcNeighFrac.py
# Author: Mario Orsi (orsimario at gmail.com)
# Purpose: Reads a LAMMPS ".trj" trajectory (dump) file and, for a
#          "main" type "i", calculates the fraction of nearest
#          neighbors of type "i" over the total number of neighbors
#          of types "main" and "other"
# Notes: - this script works for lipid bilayers arranged parallel to
#          the xy-plane, and it might need modifications to handle
#          different systems
#        - all and only the nearest 4 neighbors are considered (but
#          it should be easy to modify/generalize the script)
#        - the calculation is done separately for the two monolayers,
#          furthermore it is assumed that the input trajectory files
#          contains z coordinates that centered at 0 (so that the two
#          monolayers can be identify from their positive vs negative
#          coordinates)
